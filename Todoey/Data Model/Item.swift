    var parentCategory = LinkingObjects(fromType: Category.self, property: "items")//LonkingObjects is an auto-updating container type. It represents zero or more objects that are linked to its owning model object through a property relationship. It's simply defining the inverse relationship of items. Each category has a one to many relationship with a list of items and each item has an inverse relationship to a category called the parentCategory. Each item has a parentCategory that is of type Category and it comes from that property called "items". (if we just write Category it's not a type it is a class but if we write Category.self it becomes a type)
