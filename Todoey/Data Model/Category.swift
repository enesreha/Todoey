    //We're gonna create a constant called items and it's gonna hold a list of item objects. And we're gonna initialize it as an empty list.
    //This defines the forward relationship i.e. inside each Category there's this thing called items that's going to point to a list of Item objects. In Realm inverse relationship is not defined automatically. Instead we have to go to Item class and create it ourselves. Each category has a one to many relationship with a list of items and each item has an inverse relationship to a category called the parentCategory.
